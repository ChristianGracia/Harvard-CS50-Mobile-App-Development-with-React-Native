# Movie search App 

App is complete and fully functional

Using an two different API calls, this android/iOS app lets the user type in a query, searches a movie database, returns a list
of movies that match the query, then the user can select any of the listed movies to display more info such as
genre, director, plot, actors, year released, etc.

## Installation
I'll post installation instructions after I finish cs50m and clean up the files (folder organization) and maybe add more features.
